name: Generate and publish article feed

# This workflow runs periodically and on demand to fetch articles mentioned
# in FT podcasts and rebuild the generated RSS feed.  You can adjust the
# schedule (in cron syntax) to your preference.  Times are in UTC by
# default; Europe/London is one hour ahead in summer and may vary.  Here
# we run every six hours.
